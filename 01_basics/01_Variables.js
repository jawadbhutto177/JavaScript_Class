// Variables of JavaScript

const accountId = 62516251 // Const Variable use for One time Value , After value of variable can't change

let accountEmail = "jawad@gmail.com" // Let variable most used in programming it can change the value

var accountPassword = "Password123" //Var variable used in old time now this is not used because Scope Issues

accountCity = "Larkana" // We can assign value without define variable type but it is not right way to write code 

let accountState; // We can write variable without assign any value and it print as (Undefined)

//const accountId = 123

//console.log(accountId);

console.table([accountId, accountEmail , accountPassword, accountCity, accountState]); // Console Table used for show data in tabular form
